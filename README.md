# Project Template

This repository serves as a template for Python-based projects. It includes a structured layout, documentation guidelines, and sample configurations to get you started quickly.

---

## Features
- **Organized Folder Structure**: Clear separation of code, tests, and documentation.
- **Dependency Management**: A `requirements.txt` file for installing necessary libraries.
- **Starter Code**: Basic `app.py` file to kickstart your project.
- **Preconfigured Git Ignore**: Avoid committing unnecessary files like virtual environments and cache files.
